# Templates
This repository contains a collection of ready-to-use code templates designed to save you time by allowing you to simply copy and paste the code into your own projects. These templates cover a variety of programming languages, frameworks, and common development tasks, helping you speed up your workflow without reinventing the wheel.

All templates have been originally shared on my Instagram account, and they are optimized for quick implementation. Whether you're working on a personal project, a hackathon, or just need a quick solution, these templates are here to help!

## Features
- Ready-to-use templates: Copy and paste the code directly into your project.

# Menu with Dark Mode ðŸŒ™

Hi Everyone ðŸ‘‹,

Welcome to my **Menu with Dark Mode** project! This is a simple, yet effective, navigation menu that includes a **hover effect** and the ability to toggle between light and dark modes for a better user experience. It is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- **Responsive Menu**: A stylish menu that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Hover Effect**: Smooth hover effects when interacting with the menu items.
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Allows users to switch between light and dark modes to suit their preference.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Transitions between dark and light modes are animated for a smoother experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and content of the menu.
- **CSS**: For styling the menu and implementing the hover effects and dark mode.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and enabling the dark mode toggle.

# Simple Login Page (Frontend)

This project is a simple login page built with HTML & CSS. It serves as the frontend UI for a login system. There is no backend, so the page does not handle authentication or store data; it is just a mock-up for the login interface.

## Features

- **Login Form**: Simple user interface with fields for username/email and password.
- **Responsive Design**: The page is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Basic Validation**: Includes simple client-side validation (e.g., checking if fields are empty).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup for the page structure.
- **CSS**: Styling to make the page visually appealing.
